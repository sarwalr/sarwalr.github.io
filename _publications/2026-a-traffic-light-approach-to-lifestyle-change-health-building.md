                    <jats:p>To develop and describe a simple, culturally appropriate, evidence-based lifestyle intervention tool and administration protocol for stable NCD outpatients.</jats:p>

                    <jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>
                    <jats:p>A multidisciplinary team synthesized global (WHO) and national (ICMR-NIN) guidelines, behaviour-change principles (COM-B, Health Belief Model, self-efficacy), and patient/provider feedback to create a one-page bilingual handout containing 21 evidence-based recommendations classified using a traffic-light system (red: avoid; green: consume safely; yellow: lifestyle actions). A structured 7-step protocol was designed for administration by nurses/dietitians, physicians, and yoga instructors, incorporating motivational interviewing, lifestyle scoring (0–21), goal setting, practical demonstration, and follow-up.</jats:p>

                    <jats:title>Results:</jats:title>
                    <jats:p>The “Health Building Lifestyle Guideline” and protocol were successfully piloted in an integrative health clinic serving industrial workers. Patients and providers reported high acceptability, improved comprehension, and enthusiasm for the visual traffic-light format, numeric lifestyle score, and team-based reinforcement.</jats:p>

                    <jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title>
                    <jats:p>This novel, low-cost, replicable traffic-light lifestyle guideline with a structured 7-step delivery protocol effectively bridges the knowledge–practice gap and empowers NCD outpatients to adopt and sustain healthier behaviours. Wider implementation and formal outcome evaluation are recommended.</jats:p>
