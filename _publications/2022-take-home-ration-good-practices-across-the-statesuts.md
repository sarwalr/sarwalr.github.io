<p>POSHAN Abhiyaan, Government of India’s flagship programme, is a scheme under ICDS umbrella which converges with other programs and services delivering nutrition interventions during the first 1000-days period. One of its core interventions includes take-home rations, which aims to fill the calorie-protein-micronutrient gap among children and pregnant and lactating women in India. This THR report covers various improvisations adopted in the implementation of the THR value chain, from formulations to last-mile delivery, by the States and UTs. These practices can be taken up by state governments to leverage the existing services and strengthen THR implementation, increase the coverage, ensure better nutritional outcomes of children and pregnant &amp;amp; lactating women and hence reduce the prevalence of under nutrition in the country.</p>
