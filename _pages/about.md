Public Health physician, Public Policy and Planning leader with over three decades of experience in governments in India. I combine academic rigour, insight of what works to analyze and develop solutions to problems. Driven by a passion for excellence, and a faith in the unity of existence, I see immense potential of people taking change of their health through healthy Lifestyle, and a health system based on prevention.

Motivating and guiding lifestyle changes one person at a time, starting with the clinic, drawing policy lessons, and sharing it through policy briefs.

**My research interests** 
are in exploring the effectivness of lifestyle therapies across a spectrum of chronic conditions
